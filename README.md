## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 

### What I learned

This is the first project I have attempted to code. I have leaned heavely on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOH4zSLTnQ">Thomas Sankara's Youtube tutorial video</a> to code this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
